<p style="text-align: justify;">The appearance of new professions in the digital environment, the improvement in connections and, above all,&nbsp;<strong>the change in mentality in companies&nbsp;</strong>have made it possible for remote work to grow exponentially in recent years.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever worked with a remote web developer?&nbsp;At Yeeply we want to tell you&nbsp;<strong>about the advantages for your company of working with one&nbsp;</strong>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Advantages of working with a remote web developer</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having a remote&nbsp;web development&nbsp;supposes a whole series of benefits for your company in many aspects.&nbsp;Finding&nbsp;<strong>a web programmer with specific knowledge&nbsp;</strong>may not be an easy task.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the fact that there are more and more professionals in the IT sector, the demand for these professionals is increasing, so&nbsp;<strong>there is more competition between companies&nbsp;</strong>to sign them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This means that if you need to hire a web developer,&nbsp;<strong>there may not be many available in your city or willing to relocate&nbsp;</strong>.&nbsp;However, if you broaden your search for a web developer far and wide, the options grow enormously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it is advisable to have professionals who work with a schedule similar to yours to&nbsp;<strong>avoid possible communication problems&nbsp;</strong>that we will see later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand,&nbsp;<strong>the company saves costs by having one less worker in the office&nbsp;</strong>: electricity, space, computer and office supplies, etc., in addition to the employee's expenses.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Productivity also often benefits from remote work.&nbsp;Keep in mind that many of&nbsp;<strong>the remote web developers tend to work from home&nbsp;</strong>.&nbsp;With this, daily trips to the office are avoided.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, people who work from home avoid that focus of tension.&nbsp;They already have a suitable space in which they feel comfortable to do their work, so they&nbsp;<strong>face the day in a different way&nbsp;</strong>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Common remote work pitfalls and how to avoid them</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the work of a remote web developer can be very beneficial, it can also bring some conflicts.&nbsp;<strong>There is nothing more effective than knowing the most frequent problems&nbsp;</strong>, in order to be able to anticipate them and solve them as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Lack of organization</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, having professionals who work from home, problems arise with the organization:&nbsp;<strong>problems appear to meet deadlines, answer emails&nbsp;</strong>... With which you cannot be sure that the professional is dedicating himself to your project or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To avoid this type of conflict, it is best to make the internal processes clear at the beginning of the project.&nbsp;If you choose&nbsp;<strong>an experienced remote developer&nbsp;</strong>, you probably won't have any problems in this regard.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Lack of commitment to the project</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working remotely may mean that the remote developer does not have&nbsp;<strong>first-hand reference to the particularities of the company or project&nbsp;</strong>, nor does he feel integrated with the rest of the team.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This can mean that you carry out your work without real involvement and aspects that could improve the final result are overlooked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is recommended that, even periodically or at the beginning of the project,&nbsp;<strong>the remote worker meets the rest of the team&nbsp;</strong>and (if possible) spends some time in the offices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also equally important that&nbsp;<strong>each member of the team has a good understanding of the objectives of the project&nbsp;</strong>.&nbsp;It doesn't matter what your role or level of responsibility is.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The simple fact of making him feel an active part and transferring the motivations of the project to him will make it easier for&nbsp;<strong>the remote programmer to become actively involved&nbsp;</strong>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Communication problems</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Communication problems&nbsp;</strong>are&nbsp;often the main cause of conflict in remote workers.&nbsp;By communicating remotely, the nuances of the conversation can be lost, personal problems that may affect professional development are ignored, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important that team members have spaces in which to share information about themselves with others and&nbsp;<strong>communicate directly with the entire team&nbsp;</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, the use of tools such as&nbsp;Slack&nbsp;, which&nbsp;<strong>allows both group communication with the team and private communication&nbsp;</strong>with each component, will help provide the team with this common space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time and occasionally, making video calls with platforms such as Skype or Hangouts can&nbsp;<strong>solve the problem of distances and minimize these misunderstandings in communication&nbsp;</strong>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Tips for effective remote work management</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To work with guarantees with a remote web developer,&nbsp;<strong>it is important to make the processes clear&nbsp;</strong>and provide tools that improve team communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition,&nbsp;<strong>the use of agile methodologies will facilitate the day to day&nbsp;</strong>.&nbsp;Some of the tips to effectively manage remote work are the following:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Each member must be clear about their responsibilities.&nbsp;<strong>Putting the assignment in writing&nbsp;</strong>will help in case a member of the team has doubts about the person to whom she should go.</li>
<li>Frequently use programs such as Skype or Hangouts.&nbsp;Video calls&nbsp;<strong>help to empathize with the rest of the team members&nbsp;</strong>and devirtualize the remote programmer.</li>
<li>Simplifies day-to-day project management.&nbsp;Often, we tend to get lost in endless meetings that are not at all productive.&nbsp;<strong>Avoid unnecessary meetings&nbsp;</strong>and allow you to concentrate on your work.</li>
<li>Record in writing the progress of the project, news, agreements... The best way to do this is to use a&nbsp;project management software or tool&nbsp;in which the entire team is coordinated and the assignment of tasks, news , shared files, etc.</li>
</ul>
